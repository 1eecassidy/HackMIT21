                    Song’s current ventures include her popular fashion and lifestyle blog, a YouTube vlog,
                    her jewelry line, and a clothing line. She’s currently an ambassador for Chloé,
                    Giorgio Armani Beauty, Dior, and Revolve, and has formerly worked with Laura Mercier,
                    which earned her a reported half a million dollars for a year contract.
                    And it’s not just every social media post she touches that turns to gold—she
                     recently did a sunglasses collaboration that sold out in under 22 minutes, 
                     she was named to Forbes' 30 Under 30 list in 2016, and her book, Capture Your Style, scored a 
                     spot on The New York Times best-sellers list.

                <p>If you follow fashion blogger Aimee Song—a.k.a. Song of Style—on Instagram, you’ve seen her dancing at Coachella, posing in Tokyo, and lounging at the Hôtel Plaza Athénée during Paris Fashion Week. A never-ending vacation the uninformed onlooker might assume, but the truth is, every place Song travels to is for work. Just a different kind of work. In the desert she committed to wearing clothing from e-comm site Revolve and attended its many pop-up events; the trip to Tokyo was to party with fans; and part of her duties in Paris was to promote a new designer fragrance, which she did nestled in her gorgeous hotel suite.

                    “About a year in, brands started asking me if I wanted free clothes in exchange for posting about them,” Song says. “I was like, ‘Oh, I don’t have to shop for these?’ since I was working three jobs at the time.” Song did a few posts in exchange for clothes, then fast-fashion brands came calling.
