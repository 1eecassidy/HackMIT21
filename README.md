Many influencers have come across the problem of having way too many gifted items from brands to use or give away to friends and family. However, throwing then out seems like a waste since most times the are brand new, unused, products.

REclaim is a e-commerce platform that allows influencers  to sell their gifted items and select a charity to receive all proceeds from the sale. From the influencer's side, they can get rid of the overwhelming clutter of items while supporting a charity of their choice (and they can get a tax break from it)! REclaim is incentive focused. Each month, we will highlight the top donor who sold the most value in items on our landing page. Free PR, donating to your favorite charity, and Marie Kondo-ing your closet - what isn't there to love? From the buyers' side, customers can shop for brand new or gently worn items at more than 50% off the retail price. There's an option to bid for products as well - as  purchase a product of a set price if you're not jazzed about competition. For super fans, shopping the closet of their favorite influencer is a huge bonus. Who doesn't want to wear Ariana Grande's red carpet looks? 

REclaim provides a sleek and timeless user friendly interface. Users can choose to register as a seller and sign in to be directed towards the seller dashboard and listing pages. The seller can list their products and a deadline for bidding, and the buyer with the highest bid by the end  wins the auction. Alternatively, the seller can list their products at a set price and it's sold by first come first serve. 

By preventing new or gently used products from going to the landfill, as well as supporting charitable causes, buyers and sellers alike can have peace of heart knowing they are doing their part in being sustainable.
